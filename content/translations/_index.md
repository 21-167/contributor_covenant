We're looking for new localizations of Contributor Covenant and are thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on translations.
Instructions for translators can be found [here](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant#translating).

The Contributor Covenant uses semantic versioning for revisions so all URLs are permanent.
Previous versions are available here: [1.0](/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct/), [1.1](/version/1/1/0/code-of-conduct/), [1.2](/version/1/2/0/code-of-conduct/), and [1.3](/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/).
