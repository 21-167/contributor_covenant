We're looking for new localizations of Contributor Covenant and are
thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on translations. Now,
thanks to @wfdd, there is a [Pandoc HTML generation
template](version/1/4/.index-template.html) for v1.4 of the Contributor
Covenant.

The Contributor Covenant uses semantic versioning for revisions so all URLs are permanent.
Previous versions are available here: [1.0](/version/1/0/0/), [1.1](/version/1/1/0/), [1.2](/version/1/2/0/),
and [1.3](/version/1/3/0/).
